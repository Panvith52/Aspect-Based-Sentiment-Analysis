# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT on SemEval Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for performing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on the SemEval 2014 Task 4: Aspect Category Sentiment Classification dataset, specifically focusing on laptop reviews. The project utilizes the DistilBERT pre-trained language model, fine-tuned for this specific task.

## Introduction

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to identify the sentiment expressed towards specific aspects (e.g., "battery," "display," "price") within a given text. This project tackles the ABSA task using DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT, known for its efficiency and strong performance.  This repository provides a complete pipeline for training, evaluating, and potentially deploying an ABSA model.

## Dataset

The project uses the **SemEval 2014 Task 4: Aspect Category Sentiment Classification** dataset.  Specifically, the laptop reviews portion of the dataset is used.  The dataset contains customer reviews of laptops, with annotations for aspect categories and their corresponding sentiment polarities (positive, negative, neutral, and conflict).

* **Source:** The dataset can be obtained from the official SemEval website or through related research publications.  *(You may need to add a specific link or instructions here if you are providing the data yourself or have a specific download script.)*
* **Preprocessing:** The dataset may require preprocessing steps, such as handling XML/file formats, and converting it into a suitable format for the model.

## Model

This project utilizes the **DistilBERT** pre-trained language model from Hugging Face Transformers.  DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, and cheaper version of BERT, which retains most of its language understanding capabilities.  The model is fine-tuned on the SemEval 2014 laptop reviews dataset to predict the sentiment polarity for given aspect categories. A classification layer is added on top of DistilBERT for the sentiment classification task.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** 3.7 or higher is recommended.
* **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow:** (Choose one based on your preference and the code)
* **Transformers:** Hugging Face Transformers library.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For evaluation metrics.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** (Optional) For data visualization.
* **Google Colab:** A web browser.

A `requirements.txt` file is included in this repository to help you install the necessary packages.  These can be installed in your Google Colab environment.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your_github_username>/<your_repository_name>.git
    cd <your_repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Open in Google Colab:**
    * Open a Google Colab notebook.
    * Upload the cloned repository (or the notebook file, if separate) to your Google Drive or Colab environment.

3.  **Install the requirements:**

    In a Colab cell, run:

    ```python
    !pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Execution

The following steps outline how to run the code within the Google Colab notebook:

1.  **Prepare the dataset:**
    * Download the SemEval 2014 Task 4 laptop reviews dataset.
    * Place the dataset files in the appropriate directory within your Google Colab environment (e.g., upload them to a specific folder).  The notebook assumes a specific directory structure, so adjust paths as needed.
    * Run the data preprocessing steps provided in the notebook to convert the data into the required format.  The notebook should contain the necessary code for this.

2.  **Configure the training:**
    * The Google Colab notebook should contain a section where training parameters are defined.  Modify these parameters directly within the notebook:
        * `model_name`: "distilbert-base-uncased" (or the specific DistilBERT variant)
        * `batch_size`: The batch size for training.
        * `learning_rate`: The learning rate for the optimizer.
        * `num_epochs`: The number of training epochs.
        * `data_dir`: The directory where the dataset is located (within Colab).
        * `output_dir`: The directory to save the trained model (within Colab, or to Google Drive).
        * `max_seq_length`: The maximum sequence length.

3.  **Run the notebook:**
    * Execute the cells in the Google Colab notebook sequentially.  This will:
        * Load the dataset.
        * Load the pre-trained DistilBERT model.
        * Fine-tune the model on the training data.
        * Evaluate the model on the test data.
        * Display the evaluation metrics.
        * Save the trained model (if specified in the notebook).

## Results

The results of the model evaluation will be displayed within the Google Colab notebook after the training and evaluation cells have been executed. The key metrics to consider are:

* **Accuracy:** Overall percentage of correctly predicted aspect-sentiment pairs.
* **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** For each sentiment class (positive, negative, neutral, conflict).
* **Macro/Micro F1-score:** Overall performance across all sentiment classes.

The notebook may also contain additional analysis, visualizations, or error analysis.
