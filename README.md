# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT on SemEval Dataset

This repository contains the code and resources for performing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on the SemEval 2014 Task 4: Aspect Category Sentiment Classification dataset, specifically focusing on laptop reviews. The project utilizes the DistilBERT pre-trained language model, fine-tuned for this specific task.

## Introduction

Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to identify the sentiment expressed towards specific aspects (e.g., "battery," "display," "price") within a given text. This project tackles the ABSA task using DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT, known for its efficiency and strong performance.  This repository provides a complete pipeline for training, evaluating, and potentially deploying an ABSA model.

## Dataset

The project uses the **SemEval 2014 Task 4: Aspect Category Sentiment Classification** dataset.  Specifically, the laptop reviews portion of the dataset is used.  The dataset contains customer reviews of laptops, with annotations for aspect categories and their corresponding sentiment polarities (positive, negative, neutral, and conflict).

* **Source:** The dataset can be obtained from the official SemEval website or through related research publications.  *(You may need to add a specific link or instructions here if you are providing the data yourself or have a specific download script.)*
* **Preprocessing:** The dataset may require preprocessing steps, such as handling XML/file formats, and converting it into a suitable format for the model.

## Model

This project utilizes the **DistilBERT** pre-trained language model from Hugging Face Transformers.  DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, and cheaper version of BERT, which retains most of its language understanding capabilities.  The model is fine-tuned on the SemEval 2014 laptop reviews dataset to predict the sentiment polarity for given aspect categories. A classification layer is added on top of DistilBERT for the sentiment classification task.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python:** 3.7 or higher is recommended.
* **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow:** (Choose one based on your preference and the code)
* **Transformers:** Hugging Face Transformers library.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For evaluation metrics.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** (Optional) For data visualization.

A `requirements.txt` file is included in this repository to help you install the necessary packages.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your_github_username>/<your_repository_name>.git
    cd <your_repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the requirements:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Execution

The following steps outline how to run the code:

1.  **Prepare the dataset:**
    * Download the SemEval 2014 Task 4 laptop reviews dataset.
    * Place the dataset files in the appropriate directory (the code assumes a specific directory structure, which should be documented or configurable).
    * If necessary, run any data preprocessing scripts provided to convert the data into the required format.  ( *Add details here about preprocessing scripts, if any.*)

2.  **Configure the training:**
    * (If applicable) Modify the configuration file (e.g., `config.py`, `config.json`) to set training parameters such as:
        * `model_name`:  "distilbert-base-uncased" (or the specific DistilBERT variant)
        * `batch_size`:  The batch size for training.
        * `learning_rate`:  The learning rate for the optimizer.
        * `num_epochs`:  The number of training epochs.
        * `data_dir`: The directory where the dataset is located.
        * `output_dir`: The directory to save the trained model.
        * `max_seq_length`: The maximum sequence length.
    * ( *Add details about your configuration system.*)

3.  **Run the training script:**

    ```bash
    python train.py  # Or the name of your training script
    ```
    * This script will:
        * Load the dataset.
        * Load the pre-trained DistilBERT model.
        * Fine-tune the model on the training data.
        * Save the trained model to the specified output directory.

4.  **Evaluate the model:**

    ```bash
    python evaluate.py  # Or the name of your evaluation script
    ```
     * This script will:
        * Load the trained model.
        * Evaluate the model on the test data.
        * Print the evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

5.  **(Optional) Inference/Prediction:**
    * If you have an inference or prediction script, provide instructions on how to use it.  For example:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --text "The laptop has a great display, but the battery life is short." --aspects "display,battery"
    ```

## Results

The results of the model evaluation will be displayed on the console after running the `evaluate.py` script.  The key metrics to consider are:

* **Accuracy:** Overall percentage of correctly predicted aspect-sentiment pairs.
* **Precision, Recall, F1-score:** For each sentiment class (positive, negative, neutral, conflict).
* **Macro/Micro F1-score:** Overall performance across all sentiment classes.

A more detailed analysis of the results, including any visualizations or error analysis, should be included in a separate section or file (e.g., a Jupyter Notebook).  (*Add a link to your results analysis if applicable.*)
